# 🥦 Kenya Food Prices Analysis (2007–2025)

I started this project while writing an article on setting up an environment for data science work,  
but it has slowly morphed into a **food prices analysis**, allowing me to **freshen up what I’ve learned during my ALX journey**.

The dataset used in this project can be accessed here:  
🔗 [World Bank Microdata Catalog – Kenya Food Prices Dataset](https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/6167)

Let’s see where it takes us 🚀

## 🧭 General Trends and Overview

1. What are the overall trends in food prices (beans, maize, potatoes, and the food price index) across Kenya over the years (2007–2025)?
2. Which provinces or counties consistently have the highest or lowest food prices?(**Highest :** North Eastern, Nairobi, Riftvalley | **Lowest :** Centarl, Coast, Nyanza)
3. How do food prices vary by month or season?

---

## 🌾 Specific Commodity Analysis

1. Which commodity (beans, maize, or potatoes) has experienced the most significant price fluctuations or inflation over time?
2. Are there any specific markets where certain commodities are consistently more expensive or cheaper?

---

## 💹 Inflation and Volatility

1. How has food inflation (for beans, maize, potatoes, and the overall index) changed over the years?
2. Which regions experience the highest food price volatility?

---

## 🗺️ Geographical Analysis

1. Can we identify any geographical patterns in food prices (e.g., higher prices in certain regions due to accessibility, production, or demand)?

---

## 🔄 Relationship Between Commodities

1. Is there a correlation between the prices of different food commodities (e.g., do maize prices impact bean prices)?

## 📚 Notes

This project is part of my ongoing learning journey in **data science and analytics**,  
combining practical skills from the **ALX Data Science Program** with **Python, Pandas, and visualization tools**  
to uncover meaningful insights from Kenya’s food price data.
