    "## Breakdown based on the Line chart above \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Upward Trend Overall:\n",
    "All commodities — **beans**, **maize**, and **potatoes** — show a gradual increase in average prices from 2007 through around 2023, followed by a slight decline toward 2025.  \n",
    "This suggests **long-term inflationary pressure on food prices in Kenya**.\n",
    "### 2. Beans are consistently the most expensive:\n",
    "The **blue line(Beans)** remains well above maize and potatoes throughout the period.\n",
    "This likely reflects both higher production costs and strong demand for beans as a protein source\n",
    "### 3. Parallel movement between maize and potatoes\n",
    "The **Orange(maize)** and **green(Potatoes)** line move roughly together, meaning price changes for one often coincide with the other\n",
    "This may reflect **shared market influence** like weather condition or fuel prices that affect all stable crops.\n",
    "### 4. Food Price Index follows the same direction:\n",
    "Even though its values are smaller in scale, the **Food Price Index (red line)** mirrors the general direction of the other commodities.\n",
    "It acts as a **summary indicator** of overall food inflation, showing peaks and troughs that align with the crops’ price changes.\n",
    "### 5. Notable peaks (2022–2023):\n",
    "There’s a sharp spike across all commodities around 2022–2023, likely due to **global and local disruptions** e.g., drought, COVID-19 aftereffects, global supply chain issues or elections.\n",
    "After this spike, prices dip slightly toward 2025, suggesting a partial recovery or stabilization.\n",
    "### 2. Notable Dips\n",
    "There are **two visible dips**, around **2010** and **2018**, across most commodities.  \n",
    "These years coincide with **major election periods in Kenya** (the 2010 constitutional referendum and the 2017 general election).  \n",
    "Such events often influence food prices through **market disruptions, political uncertainty, and short-term policy changes** that affect production and distribution.\n"
